								<h4>3. Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h4>
								<p>After analysing and examining the Burning Glass data, everyone’s overall opinion on their ideal job has not changed at all. They are still willing to pursue their ideal jobs.  This is due to the fact that most of our ideal jobs are higher up in the Top IT Job Titles List of March 2018. With Web  Developer being quite high up the on this list with around 380 job postings, the opinion on this job is still the same as it is quite high in demand and desirable. This would be a little more effortless for the individual to get their ideal job if they possessed the desired skill set. Software developer is also high up in the list with approximately 340 postings and the skills that are required for this job is also desirable for many other jobs. So if this job does not work out, the individual can easily find another job that would need similar skills. The remaining ideal jobs such as UI Designer, IT Operations and Information Architect are somewhere in the middle of the least or towards the end, however the desired skills are all useful within other jobs if ever the individual makes an attempt for a higher experienced job.</p>
