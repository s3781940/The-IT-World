							<h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
							<b>Kelly Nguyen</b>
							<p>Well to briefly conclude, I personally really like my group in terms of communication,cooperation and contribution. We equally assigned different segments of the assignment for each team member to complete, and everything was done coherently without any problems. Everyone seemed to have fulfilled the assignment at the same and steady pace, so no one was falling behind. I made a group chat on facebook messenger where we could all consistently keep up with each other’s progress and share our queries. However, I did notice that my teammates are rather quiet if I wasn’t the person who initiates the conversations once in a while to check up and make deadlines. But that’s okay as everyone was passive and got the job done!</p>

							<b>Trisha Cagdan</b>
							<p>My group was very good with cooperating with each other as we were all given specific parts to do for the report and we all finished it before the deadline. We all equally contributed to the report and there were no problems as well in completing our parts. Surprisingly, everybody was finishing their parts in time even though we all have different timetables and have other commitments outside school, we all accomplished our tasks on time. The group was somewhat not good with communicating with each other that much but we still completed our tasks in the end.</p>

							<b>Anushee Haque</b>
							<p>In regards to how well we have done, I’d say we all did pretty well since we worked as a team. We all contributed, working towards a goal: to finish the assignment. We worked at one part at a time, in a steady pace. We were given the choice to assign our own roles for each segment, and we all completed them by each of our mini-deadlines. Everyone put their all into the assignment. By using the facebook group chat, we were able to effectively communicate about assignment. It was good reassurance that if there was a question about anything, it would be answered in the chat. But most of the time, the group knew what to do and what their roles were. And in the end, we pulled through and finished it, just as planned.</p>

							<b>Helen Do</b>
							<p>Overall, I believe our group cooperated well with each other to get the assignment finished before the deadline which is great. Everyone contributed equally towards the assignment and completed their parts on the agreed time each week which made sure that we were never falling behind or leaving anything to the last minute. Each week we had a set objective of where we had to be up to before the next week, which we were able to achieve each time. In regards to our communication, it was quite decent as we had a group chat on a platform where everyone was most likely to be active on which helped everyone stay on track and able to ask any relevant questions. Ultimately, we were able to finish all our tasks and overall the assignment together.</p>

							<b>Erin Maligeorges</b>
							<p>I believe that our group worked well and got everything that we needed to get done, on time and at a high standard. I would definitely work with this group again if I had the opportunity. Our communication could have been improved a bit better but as there was a lot of people in our group it was quite difficult to communicate with everyone but we did a good job at trying. One thing that was surprising to me is the efficient use of time in our practical classes, we worked hard to make sure we finished on time. Something that I’ve learnt is that it is hard to communicate with a larger group as everyone does have different schedules and priorities, although with this group we did no have too much troubles at all with this.</p>

							<b>Luke Huynh</b>
							<p>To recap, I believe that our group was able to get along and cooperate with each other very well, as we were able to complete our designated tasks that we allocated for one another effectively and efficiently. Although our communication with each other wasn’t on a perfect level, it was good enough to be able to feel comfortable to approach one another when we had questions or queries about the given tasks, whether it be in person or within a group chat on messenger. The tasks given was distributed equally amongst all of our group members, meaning everyone had contributed and was able to get involved equally. Also, we were all able to complete our share of work in the time we intended as well, despite our different time schedules and commitments.</p>

							<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
							<b>1. What went well?</b>
							<p>I think what went well with this group assignment was that we were all able to equally give each member a task to accomplish and were able to complete our allocated tasks on time and produced high quality work. Since from the start we were all contributing to the assignment and we were able to finish most sections early. And because of having such a strong start, we were able to finish before the deadline.</p>

							<b>2. What could be improved?</b>
							<p>I believe although our communication was pretty good, it could be improved so that it wasn’t just the same one or two people initiating the conversations to check-up on everyone. As if there wasn’t those people initiating then maybe the group wouldn’t have been communicating as much or at all. But other then that, we all still got the job done, and was quite good at communicating during the tutorials to make sure everyone knew what to complete in their own time.</p>

							<b>3. At least one thing that was surprising.</b>
							<p>We were all able to stay on top of our work and whenever one of us asked for something to be done, it would be done very quickly without any problems. This is a good quality that I found surprising because I know some groups so struggle to maintain on top of their assigned work in a group due to other priorities but I think we did a good job doing this.</p>

							<b>4. At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</b>
							<p>I’ve learnt that working as a team can be benefiting and challenging at the same time. For instance, having a group coming up with several different ideas is better than having an individual coming up with just one; but sometimes the group ideas could clash causing a disagreement. Additionally, being in a group is beneficial, as you are able to clarify and improve your responses within the assessment with your group, which is much more reassuring to you knowing that members of your group agree with you. In contrast, group work can be somewhat hard to manage if you want to check what has and hasn’t been completed due to the amount of work being a lot larger than individual tasks.</p>
