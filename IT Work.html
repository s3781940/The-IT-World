								<h2>Interview an IT professional</h2>
								<h4>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h4>
								<p>Our chosen IT professional used to be an IT consultant, which the job basically involves designing learning modules. Learning modules are instructional courses to train people on a variety of skills. Whilst working as a consultant, you must go in, talk to the client, find out what they need, and finally design the module according to their needs.</p>

								<h4>Please tell us about the industry you work in. </h4>
								<p>The IT consulting industry, according to him, focuses on advising companies and organisations on how to better their use with information technology in achieving their objectives and goals.</p>

								<h4>What other kinds of work do you have to do? </h4>
								<p>Other kinds of works that he has to do is to is write, test and support custom software for the specific client according to their needs and what it needs to achieve. He also helped clients with their network security by improving it to prevent any intruders and such. </p>

								<h4>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? </h4>
								<p>He would mostly interact with his clients. At one point, he was a project manager.  In addition to interacting with the clients, he also spoke to his team members including programmers and content developers. Being a project manager usually converses with everyone.</p>

								<h4>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? </h4>
								<p>The IT professional spent most of his time interacting with his clients and having coffee with them. He used to have a coffee account that contained a fund of $200 a week. Therefore most of his time was spent talking to his clients as it was important to find out what they really want, but most of the time they don’t until he has a discussion with them.</p>

								<h4>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4>
								<p>Conversing with clients would have to be the most challenging aspect in his position. The work itself is fairly straightforward, as a lot of the time if you know what they need, the skills of the team members are enough to handle most of the situations. But it is finding out what the clients truly want is the problem. Also, clients would often change their minds half way through the process, unaware that it is extremely difficult to go back to the beginning without costing a whole amount of money. Therefore, we must make sure that the clients know what exactly it is they want and where the limits are, because some may want something that their money cannot extend to.</p>

								<h4>Does the IT professional like their position?</h4>
								<p>Yes, he liked his role as it paid really well. Being an IT consultant would mean that you must have a few years of experience. However, the downside is that oneself must work a lot. He would work about 60-80 hours a week. You would have to keep working until the project is done. Overall, he did like it but it wasn’t something he would continue in pursuing for a long time, as it completely drains you. He burnt out after about 3 years and left to become an IT teacher. It was really challenging but also always interesting.</p>

								<h4>Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h4>
								<p>There isn’t a specific example as he just helps many businesses implements technology to solve any business problems or achieve new goals.  However, he has said, everytime the new strategies and implementations are successful, it is a big accomplishment to him.</p>
