								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
								<h5>Kelly Nguyen</h5>
								<p>My name is Kelly Nguyen and I am currently studying the course Bachelor of Information Technology at Rmit University. My given student number is 's3785735'. I was born in Australia back in the year of 2001, March the 5th. I have a Vietnamese background in which I consider myself fluent in. My hobbies are playing the piano and badminton. My interest for IT first sparked back in my VCE studies where I completed IT as a subject. Initially, I wasn’t too fond of the IT branch but I soon became interested as I was good at it and began to enjoy it throughout the course. The idea of Information Technology intrigues me as our current world immensely depends on technology in terms of every single aspect in our daily lives. Despite only having my IT VCE studies as my only IT experience, I want to continue in building myself and become part of advancing technology that our society highly depends on.</p>

							    <h5>Luke Huynh</h5>	
								<p>Hi, my name is Luke (Van Long Luke Huynh), my student number is s3786081 and I am currently studying a Bachelor Of Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in Australia in 2000 and my ethnicity is of a Vietnamese background. My hobbies and interests are listening to music and going to festivals, playing and watching sports such as AFL, Soccer, NBA etc and sometimes playing JRPG’s and FPS games. My interest in the field of IT was firstly forged through my hobby of gaming, where I built my own gaming PC. Building my first PC allowed my basic knowledge of hardware and technology to be further expanded into an advanced level, where I began putting my own time into this passion to find out new concepts and ideas. My overall IT experience is average as I didn’t do any related subjects during my VCE, however I am currently keen to learn new things.</p>

								<h5>Erin Maligeorges</h5>
								<p>Hello, my name is Erin Maligeorges and my student number is s3785430. I was born in Australia but I am fully Greek. I am currently in my first year studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. My hobbies and interests include, playing with my cat Kylo and dog Kobe. I also have a fighter fish but it’s very hard to play with him. I’m mainly interested in user design and web programming because I enjoy making easy to use applications for people because I know exactly how it feels to use a website that isn’t user friendly. I haven’t had a lot of professional experience in the IT community but I am currently working at Vodafone so I do talk to people everyday about the specifications of devices. Adding on, I have always been that go to person when it comes to troubleshooting, my friends and family always know to come to me if they have a problem with anything technology related.</p>

								<h5>Trisha Cagdan</h5>
								<p>My name is Trisha Cagdan and my student number is s3780112. I was born in Philippines and I moved here in Melbourne 3 years ago. My hobbies are mostly reading, watching movies or tv shows and social media. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, programming,  User Interface, and mostly the designing part of IT. My interest in IT started when I chose to do computing in year 10 and continued till year 12, the topics were very interesting and came naturally to me. But I wasn’t really too keen to study IT in Uni because I am more interested in design and media but I thought in the end that IT will be a better choice and decided to give it try. I only had one IT experience which was a work experience in TATA consultancy during my year 11 where we had to work with other group of girls who are also interested in IT. There was a project in the end where we were in groups where we had to pitch in ideas on how to further enhance the website of AGL and fortunately, my group won.</p>

								<p>My name is Anushee Haque and my student number is s3791827. I was born in Bangladesh in the year 2000, but I moved here in Australia in 2002, before my second birthday. I am currently studying the Bachelor is Information Technology at RMIT. My hobbies include listening to music, watching movies and tv shows and exploring (travelling). I’m mostly interested in the design/development part of IT more than the other aspects that IT has to offer. My interest in IT started when I chose it as an elective in year 10. I took it every year since then and I enjoyed it more than all my other subjects. I was excited to study IT at university because a lot of the topics that we learnt in VCE are familiar in some subjects. One of my more major IT experiences involving getting the opportunity to work in an industry. It was called the Go4IT program for girls who are interested in IT. We worked at TATA Consultancy Services with a large group of girls from different schools in year 11. In this program, we learnt about the importance of IT in everyday life and how it can be intertwined with business, law and other areas of work. Some of us weren’t familiar with programming for example, and others are more experienced with project planning. There was a lot of group work involved and I believe the <br/>program was to get girls/women to unite, work together, learn from each other and <br/>build relationships as well as giving insight to what it would be like to be in the workforce.</p>

								<h5>Helen Do</h5>
								<p>My name is Helen Do and my student number is 3781940. For my studies, I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University. I am Vietnamese but was born in Australia in 2001. I actually have visited Vietnam almost every year since I was born. My hobbies include playing the violin (but rarely these days) and just watching a lot of TV Shows in most of my spare time. My interest in IT started in secondary school, doing it as a VCE subject, I found it more interesting as the school year went on and I gained more knowledge on the subject. Honestly before this, I also did IT as an elective in Year 8 or 9 but found it quite boring and had no interest in it whatsoever. I only decided to continue it in university as thought it would be a great career path to pursue and was also advised to by my teacher. I am interested in web developing and designing aspect of this course.</p>

								<h2>Team Profile</h2>
								<h5>Kelly Nguyen</h5>
								<p>Well considering my past teamwork experiences, I believe that my given label by the ‘16personalities’ test of being an "extrovert" is needed in every team. Without people like me, it would be difficult for a group to communicate and cooperate well in delivering their ideas and contribution to assignments. With my outwardness and bright personality, I'll naturally guide all my group members, somewhat like a leader, and ensure that every individual is included and have their voice heard and opinions respected. In combination with my reasonably high percentage in creativity resulted by ‘Testmycreativity’ test, I will be able to contribute to my group in terms of coming up with unique ideas that’ll differentiate us from others.</p>
								<br/>

								<h5>Luke Huynh</h5>
								<p>The results of these tests show that I tend to be process information visually and my strongest personality is being able to understand and agree with a range of situations. The results may influence my behaviour in a team as it gives me a better understanding of what I should be working on to ensure that I'm contributing to the best of my ability with those im working with. I should take this into account when forming a team to make sure what I can bring into the group will be beneficial for all and for myself.</p>
								<br/>

								<h5>Erin Maligeorges</h5>
								<p>By looking at my results from the 16Personalities test, I am someone who  thrives off social engagement. I also have a lot of feelings and am quite turbulent which means I can be a bit of a self-conscious perfectionist. I believe this test is very true because I do consider myself to have these traits already. Also according to my learning style, I am a more tactile learner which means i learn more by touching and doing as opposed to reading out loud or looking at images.</p>
								<br/>

								<h5>Trisha Cagdan</h5>
								<p>Although the results says that I am an Introvert, this is not a big problem in group projects as there are other aspects of my personality that will be a big help in contributing in the group. I am very dedicated and hardworking, this would be great in a group as I will give my very best in everything I do and finish the work before the due date. I am also very creative which will be a good trait in coming up with ideas for designing the website.</p>
								<br/>

								<h5>Anushee Haque</h5>
								<p>According to these tests, I learned more about who I am, like the fact that I am more of an introvert than an extrovert. That I tend to be more of a visual learner than an auditory and a tactile learner. That I tend to agree and have more of an imagination than extroversion. These tests would portray how I am like in the workplace as well as in just normal day to day life. These results would heavily influence a team that I would be working with. This is because I everyone has different characteristics and skills to bring to the table. I am hardworking and always try to do my best in everything that I do, especially of its a project that involves the design of something. I’m very good at adapting and being turbulent to the environment and people around me, and I aim to use that to my advantage when I work with various groups in the future.</p>
								<br/>

								<h5>Helen Do</h5>
								<p>Taking these results into consideration, according to the 16Personalities test, I am described as strong-willed and dutiful, where I would be working hard and staying focused on my goals. I am also said to be calm and practical which I believe I am as I never lose my temper or break down at every sign of hardship which would enable me to be make clearer, rational decisions . It is also said that I would be very responsible as I have a strong will to fulfill any assigned duties that I have committed to. As stated by the creativity test, my score being lower than the typical person, I agree that I’m not very creative in some areas. Therefore it would be great if there were other creative people in the group to make up for what I lack.</p>

								<h4>Ideal Jobs</h4>
								<h5>Kelly Nguyen</h5>
								<p>My ideal job is to become a <b>Software</b> or <b>Web Developer</b>.</p>

								<h5>Luke Huynh</h5>
								<p>My ideal job is to work in <b>IT Operations</b> with any major tech company.</p>
								
								<h5>Erin Maligeorges</h5>
								<p>My ideal job is to be a <b>Software Developer</b>.</p>

								<h5>Trisha Cagdan</h5>
								<p>My ideal job is to be a <b>UI Designer</b>.</p>

								<h5>Anushee Haque</h5>
								<p>My ideal job is to be an <b>Information Architect</b>.</p>

								<h5>Helen Do</h5>
								<p>My ideal job is to be a <b>Web Developer</b>.</p>
								<br/>

								<p>The common elements amongst our dream jobs are that each of our ideal job requires knowledge about programming, HTML, and CSS. Most of our ideal jobs also involves working in a group and communicating with the client.The things that differentiates each position from the others is the knowledge and skills that are required for each job. They each require different training or internships to assist in providing insight into the different industries and getting exposed to different programming or coding languages, where each job may require a specific language or multiple of them. </p>

								<p>Comparing our ideal jobs, it is visible that we all have similar ideas on what we want to do after we graduate. Most of us want to be a software / web developer whilst the others have more unique approaches such as being an information architect. The similarities that all these jobs have with each other is the design aspect. They all revolve around designing, whether that be designing a website, software or a user interface, therefore showing that we all have creative sides to us. </p>

								<p>The similarities of our career plans are to complete our Bachelor of Information Technology and hopefully graduate from RMIT University in the year 2021. We also intend to apply for internships during our course studies to enhance our learning and experience before graduating and finding our first full time job, as it’ll create an easier entry for us all. The differences of our career plans is that we have different ideal jobs, meaning our intentions may be varied going into the future.</p>
