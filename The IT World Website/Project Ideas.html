							<h2>Downloadify</h2>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>We have come up with the idea of <b>‘downloadify!’</b> This application allows users to install a program on their tablet, phone or computer that monitors downloads from another device. This application would help ease the problem of sitting and waiting around your computer for your long download to be ready. By sending a notification to your device letting you know that your time consuming download is ready! </p>

<h5>How It Works</h5>
<p>To describe in detail, the user will install downloadify on 2 devices, the device that they are going to be carrying with them for eg. their phone and then on their laptop which will be installing the update or download. The application will ask the user to pair the devices, a pairing password and particle will pop up, allowing the user to have an option to scan . The user will then be asked whether the device they are currently on is the ‘downloading’ device or the ‘non-downloading’ device. So in this case, the phone would be the non-downloading device and the laptop would be the downloading device because this is the device making the update or download. Once the download is complete, the user will get a notification from the application on their phone which will state the devices name and that the download is complete. For eg. “Erin’s Macbook Pro Download is Complete.”</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>Instead of the user having to hang around their laptop waiting for the download to be complete, they are able to complete other tasks in the meantime and then receive a notification on their phone when the download is complete. This would increase an individual's efficiency and ability to get more things done during the day. </p>

<h5>Potential Problems</h5>
<p>Although this application would be deemed beneficial for all, there may be some problems that we will have to overcome along the way. For eg, if the computer was to restart after installing an update / download, how would it be able to notify the person that their update has been completed? We would have to make it possible that the application can automatically re-open on the computer and then send the notification to the person. If the application wasn’t to reopen then the user would not get the notification and then the app would be pointless to them. Another problem may be the compatibility on every phone, tablet and computer, we would have to ensure that there is full compatibility of all operating systems and on androids and IOS devices. </p>

<h5>What we need to research / observe</h5>
<p>• Where individuals are when they are downloading / updating a device (eg. in their bed or standing around the device waiting for the download)<br/>
• If the user uses their phone in the meantime<br/>
• If the user carries their phone on them in the meantime<br/>
• User feedback on how beneficial this application would be to them<br/>
• The type of device that they make the most downloads on</p>
